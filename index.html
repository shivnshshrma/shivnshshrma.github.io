            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a DevOps Engineer passionate about building scalable, resilient infrastructure that empowers
                development teams to ship faster and more reliably. With expertise in cloud platforms (AWS, GCP),
                containerization, and CI/CD automation, I bridge the gap between development and operations to create
                seamless deployment pipelines.</p>
            <p>My approach centers on infrastructure-as-code, automated testing, and continuous improvement. I believe
                in treating infrastructure with the same rigor as application code—version-controlled, tested, and
                reproducible. Whether it's optimizing cloud costs, reducing deployment times, or ensuring 99.9% uptime,
                I thrive on solving complex distributed systems challenges that directly impact business outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>GXCO Tech Pvt. Ltd.</h3>
            <p><strong>Software Developer (Remote)</strong> | July 2024 - Present</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and built the financial core of NGOERP using Python, JavaScript, and Frappe, creating a
                    multi-level approval workflow that reduced expense processing time by 40%.</li>
                <li>Automated the entire reimbursement cycle, enabling the system to auto-route approved vendor and
                    employee payments to the bank, successfully eliminating manual data-entry errors.</li>
                <li>Engineered a custom <b>Leave Allocation Algorithm</b> that replaced spreadsheet tracking, ensuring
                    100%
                    accuracy in leave accruals for over 100 employees based on dynamic organizational policies.</li>
                <li>Managed SQL databases directly to resolve critical data inconsistencies and generate custom
                    financial reports that the standard ERP tools could not provide.</li>
                <li>Streamlined the deployment process by implementing CI/CD pipelines, which cut release times by 30%
                    and allowed the team to deliver features faster and more reliably.</li>
